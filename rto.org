* Day 1
** Red Teaming
*** Definition
Testing your own organization of the unexpected by acting as 
a simulated adversary, in a simulated attack.

*** What it is not

Exploiting everything we can find - probably not, there can be honeypots on the network.
If the action is not going to take us closer to the objective, let's not pursue it,
we cannot go everywhere due to limited time.

*** Cleaning up after the engagement

Cleaning up may not be necessary - depending on the engagement.

If you do a full clean up afterwards, it's going to be harder 
for the blue team to investigate. Part of the blue team workshop
should be to train the team. 

This can depend on the maturity of the target organization, 
to see if they are shipping logs and can search from that.

*** Tips
You should have an online presence to back your story up
(in case the receptionist googles you)
